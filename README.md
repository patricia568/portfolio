Design is something that doubtlessly captivates me. And likewise, I absorb design from absolutely everything I look at like a sponge.

But what really draws me to the aspect of design is being able to solve problems in a visually imaginative way. In such a way that people wouldn't even think of.

I feel such bliss knowing that my design solutions are contributing to someone else's success.

That, to me, is something that sparks passion.
