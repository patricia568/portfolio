    typefaces.primary: |
      BenchNine was selected because it is a simple and clean looking sans-serif typeface that acts as a compliment to the more decorative display fonts.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Dorsa was selected for the headings of the website because it offers a thin and narrow type appearance, while also keeping true to the retro style.
    typefaces.accent: |
      Capitol was chosen as the tertriary font choice because of its retro appearance for accent elements such as buttons.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary colours are representative of the time period in which most of the items being sold in were popular.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colours act as compliments to the primary colours by being lighter in colour and more muted.
