Then explaining it to the general public? Meh, what have I got to lose. Here's the situation. My name is Patricia, and I am a student graphic designer based in Ottawa, Ontario. I have an INTENSE passion for solving problems in the most artistically original way. I do have a special place in my heart for web design, however, all aspects of graphic design give me a wonderful feeling inside. Throughout this website, you will be able to uncover some graphical pieces that I have completed throughout my student career. Explore away!" image="/images/me-graphic.png" %}
