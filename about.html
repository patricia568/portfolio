I have an INTENSE passion for solving problems in the most artistically original way. I do have a special place in my heart for web design, however, all aspects of graphic design give me a wonderful feeling inside. Throughout this website, you will be able to uncover some graphical pieces that I have completed throughout my student career. Explore away!" image="/images/me-graphic.png" %}
