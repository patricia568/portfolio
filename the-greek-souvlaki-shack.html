  {% pattern sections/case-study-sketches subtitle-2="The Ideas from my Brain" sub-subtitle-2="Sketching sketches" content-sketches="The first initial direction for the logo was to keep the Acropolis pillars of the original logo; which describes the wordmark of the brand from the word “shack”. This goes hand-in-hand with how the brand is perceived from the surface." image-3="/images/branding-sketches-1.jpg" content-sketches-2="I then started to explore a bolder approach from the restaurant's motto; which is 'Where the Greek Gods come to dine'. This is where more explorative elements are introduced to the design, such as a spartan helmet to signify a God, an olive branch to signify cuisine, and a Greek pattern to signify culture." image-4="/images/branding-sketches-2.jpg" content-sketches-3="After endless back-and-forth discussions with myself over the direction of the artwork, I decided to go with the bolder approach. It was the stronger direction of the two options, and made more of an impact as a brand identifier." image-5="/images/branding-sketches-3.jpg" %}

The combination of both these colours together give the logo a unified and eye-catching look. The muted tones of blue are not overpowering the logo’s appearance, but actually compliment the artwork and its message." content-font="The Cronos font is very reflective of the contemporary, yet traditional feel the brand projects. Used as the font for the brand's wordmark, it works in unification with the logo. Program OT is the perfect addition to the pairing for body copy. Both fonts paired together project the feel of a modern Greek brand." %}
