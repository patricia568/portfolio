During my time there, I not only performed data analysis as my main job, but I also had the opportunity to design a PowerPoint presentation to train Data Quality Analysts living in each Canadian region!" challenge-subtitle="The Mission" challenge-content="Since the training presentation was to last 2 full days, I wanted the PowerPoint to be visually engaging. As the content of the presentation is quite heavy and lengthy, it was important to engage the trainees with creative content organization. Oh and I forgot to mention the challenge: the only tool I could use was Microsoft Powerpoint...(I know, right? WOAH.)" alt-graphic="A graphic of a bar graph using Transport Canada's colours to represent the presentation design" %}

I organized sections of content, such as areas where regulations were listed, into creative bullets. I also made sure to incorporate the already existing colour palette of Transport Canada's brand into the presentation. Since the colours were already so bright and diverse, it made the presentation a little bit more appealing to look at for a grand total of 2 full days." image-3="/images/presentation-sketch1.jpg" content-sketches-2="By using imagery and strategic placement of type, I was even able to make lengthy definitions look interesting enough to read forever." image-4="/images/presentation-sketch2.jpg" content-sketches-3="I utilized the widescreen format of the presentation by halving some of the slides. This separates the heavy content from respective titles. Colours are used also to create a more inviting feel. Though not initially visible, each colour throughout the presentation actually corresponds to each presenter. This helps the presenters recognize when it's time to begin speaking their part." image-5="/images/presentation-sketch3.jpg" alt-sketch_img1="An image of a few slides placed in a mockup from the training presentation" alt-sketch_img2="An image of a few slides placed in a mockup from the training presentation" alt-sketch_img3="An image of a few slides placed in a mockup from the training presentation" %}

The combination of both these colours together give the logo a unified and eye-catching look. The muted tones of blue are not overpowering the logo’s appearance, but actually compliment the artwork and its message." content-font="The Cronos font is very reflective of the contemporary, yet traditional feel the brand projects. Used as the font for the brand's wordmark, it works in unification with the logo. Program OT is the perfect addition to the pairing for body copy. Both fonts paired together project the feel of a modern Greek brand." %}
